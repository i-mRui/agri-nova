AgriNova is a farmers' simulator app made to make farming smarter & more sustainable by turning NASA's space data into easy to use tools for farmers, from Monitoring crops & soil health to adapting to climate changes, we aim to help communities grow more food with fewer resources.

Our project is a web-based educational farming game that uses NASA’s open datasets to simulate real agricultural activities such as irrigation, fertilization, and livestock management. It is important because farmers and communities face growing challenges from climate change, resource scarcity, and the need for sustainable food production, yet advanced tools and data often remain inaccessible or too complex. By turning NASA’s satellite imagery and climate data into interactive, easy-to-understand scenarios, the game educates players on the impact of their choices, encourages sustainable practices, and bridges the gap between space technology and real-world farming.
